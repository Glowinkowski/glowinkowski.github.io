            + "the opportunity to focus on the internal world of ideas and concepts. She is often capable of working for extended periods alone enjoying the "

            + "and connection with others.&lt;/p>";

        assertiveness = "&lt;p>Specimen shows a marginal preference for Asserting. This suggests a tendency to feel comfortable sharing and asserting their views with others "
            + "and providing direction. At the same time, she will have the capacity to also keep their own counsel. Nevertheless, their preference is to assert and "
            + "in this context, Specimen will be comfortable pushing themselves forward, stating what she thinks, and in a leadership context articulating what "
            + "needs to be done and the direction required. This upside of asserting is clear in terms of an individual's capacity to be open with their views and "
            + "deliver direction setting input. The downside however, can sometimes involve a lack of listening and empathy towards others with the risk of "

        changeorientation = "&lt;p>Specimen's profile shows a moderate preference towards the Revolutionary side of the dimension. This suggests that Specimen is more energized "

            + "her tendency is to be orientated towards more practical tasks and today's delivery. Specimen can be comfortable in both the domains of "

            + "but is likely to prefer for them to have a practical application.&lt;/p>";

        decisionmaking = "&lt;p>Specimen has a marginal preference towards the Intuitive. This suggests that she prefers to use an intuition based approach to solving problems "
            + "and making decisions. In this context, decision making is driven by her own insight and gut feeling about a situation irrespective of what the data says. "
            + "This is not to say that rational facts are not thought out to validate an approach it simply implies that the approach of the intuitive decision maker "

            + "getting caught up in analysis by paralysis. The downside of course, is that sometimes important information can be missed. Specimen's profile "
            + "does show a balance and so she will be comfortable flexing towards the Rational when required.&lt;/p>";

            + "engagement style with others rather than tough minded and detached. There is a preference for maintaining harmony and warm connections with "
            + "others. Affiliative individuals are often aware of the needs and feelings of others and will accommodate them if possible, avoiding being hurtful or "
            + "creating disharmony. Affiliative types enjoy liking and being liked by others with an emphasis on the needs of people rather than the task. The "
            + "upside of Affiliation is about relationships and engagement style together with the capacity to influence and network. The downside however "
            + "relates to the individual's ability to address difficult issues and focus on the needs of the task over and above the needs of people. Specimen's "
            + "profile although relatively balanced and suggesting the ability to flex into the Unaffiliative side of the dimension is nevertheless orientated towards "

        trust = "&lt;p>Specimen shows a moderate preference towards Questioning. This implies a tendency for them to be more cautious when dealing with others in "
            + "the first instance and more readily question what other people's motives might actually be. She is likely to suspend judgement over where "
            + "someone may be coming from until they prove themselves worthy of the task. The upside of Questioning is that sometimes caution of others can "
            + "be well placed in that you need some evidence to be sure about someone. The downside however, can be lack of openness and engagement on "
            + "initial meeting thus risking openness and trust in the earlier stages of the relationship. Specimen's position on this dimension is relatively "
            + "balanced suggesting she can flex into Trusting. Nevertheless their orientation is towards the more Questioning.&lt;/p>";

        conformity = "&lt;p>Specimen's profile indicates a strong preference towards Dissenting. This implies she has a tendency to focus on what she disagrees with, or "
            + "thinks is wrong, with an idea, finding it fairly easy to find an opposing view. The essence of Dissenting is the idea of the individual being quite "
            + "independently minded with more of a tendency to disagree and see the downsides of the group view than to feel agreeable and collaborative. "
            + "Dissenting types feel more comfortable and able to ask tough probing questions about how the group is performing. The upside of Dissenting is "
            + "the opportunity for challenge and a different perspective, while the downside can sometimes be disruptive behaviour when collaboration is "
            + "needed. Specimen's profile is firmly towards the Dissenting end of the scale, the upside being their capacity to challenge colleagues and think "
            + "differently, the downside being the need to sometimes adopt a more collaborate team orientated approach. The extent to which a 'dissenter' "
            + "actually articulates their views will be strongly influenced by how assertive and confident they feel.&lt;/p>"

        modesty = "&lt;p>Specimen shows a moderate preference towards Assuming. This suggests their tendency for an Assuming approach where she will like to receive "
            + "acknowledgement for their own individual contribution and feel comfortable about promoting and talking about those accomplishments with "
            + "others. The essence of Assuming is an individual's preparedness to talk about what they have achieved rather than holding their 'light under a "
            + "bushel'. The upside of Assuming is of course the capacity to establish a broader personal profile together with an ability to promote the broader "
            + "accomplishments of the team and / or organisation and this can have a positive leadership impact.The downside can be the risk of being perceived "
            + "as boastful or arrogant. Specimen's position on the profile suggests she can flex into the Modest end of this dimension. She is however orientated "
            + "towards the Assuming side.&lt;/p>";

        implementationstyle = "&lt;p>The Outcome/Spontaneous dimension relates to an individual's preference for a structured/organised as opposed to a flexible approach for the "
            + "delivery of outcomes and results. Specimen shows a marginal preference for being Spontaneous. This means she brings a flexibility to their "
            + "approach but also likely to be able to plan for the end goal bearing it in mind as she experiments with the process. She is likely to enjoy balancing "
            + "multiple tasks simultaneously but will be able to focus on each sufficiently to get it completed. She enjoys keeping their options open for as long "
            + "as possible and can sometimes enjoy the experience more than the outcome. Specimen's natural approach to delivery is to be flexible in approach "
            + "keeping options open and retaining the capacity to change course if required.The profile does show a balance, however, and so Specimen can be "
            + "comfortable flexing towards the Outcome side of the scale.&lt;/p>";

            + "She is likely to be able to move quickly through information and detail, picking out the main relevant points and should, therefore, be able to "
            + "handle a volume of information without getting overwhelmed. She is likely to feel frustrated when required to focus in and concentrate on the "
            + "details: as a result she may sometimes miss important information or fail to make thorough preparations. Specimen's natural approach is Cursory "
            + "rather than Conscientious and therefore prefers the overview and bigger picture rather than the nuts and bolts of the detail. This of course has its "
            + "advantages and disadvantages.&lt;/p>";

        achievementorientation = "&lt;p>Specimen shows a clear preference towards the Pragmatist. This suggests that she prefers an approach which involves delivering the appropriate "
            + "level of quality to get the job done or meet the expectations of others (e.g.customers). This 'fit for purpose' approach for standards involves "
            + "flexibly adjusting the standards of work which is done in order to, for instance, meet a deadline or keep down costs. Specimen may feel impatient "
            + "with standards, or procedures, that she judges to be inefficient or wasteful and she may occasionally feel the need to cut corners in the pursuit of a "
            + "goal. The upside of being Pragmatic is an ability to deliver on time and cost together with more of a willingness to delegate and thus use their time "
            + "more effectively. The downside of course is sometimes a lack of focus in terms of standards of excellence.&lt;/p>";
