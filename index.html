                    The GPI helps people assess their natural predispositions and provides understanding in terms of the individual’s natural or preferred style of behaviour – who they are, rather than what they necessarily do. The GPI profile provides the individual with feedback in terms of three main themes:
                    <ul class="top">
                        <li class="text">Problem Solving and Implementation</li>
                        <li class="text">Communication and Interpersonal Style</li>
                        <li class="text">Feelings and Self-control</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    In addition to these themes, the GPI also provides insights in terms of Entrepreneurship Style, Learning Style, career drivers, leadership and relationships. The GPI is fundamentally ‘non-pejorative’ in that all individual profiles are positive and should be seen in this light. We aim to use the feedback to help an individual develop a sense of what comes (in behavioural terms) naturally, and less naturally. Each element of the profile, therefore, suggests a potential ‘strength’ together with a potential ‘downside’ – or risk for the individual. For example, an individual who is naturally Affiliative can be skilled at delivering difficult messages to others in a friendly style, but may sometimes avoid the confrontation. On the other hand, an Unaffiliative individual is less likely to avoid confrontation and is perhaps more task orientated, but may need to develop a ‘warmer/kindly’ style of delivery. In this sense, all profiles, whatever the shape, can provide powerful insight for the individual in terms of strengths and risks.

                <p class="text">
                    The GPI is based on research with more than 60,000 senior global leaders and their immediate reports. This shows that what differentiates outstanding from average performers has essentially two features. Firstly, outstanding performers establish/find an environment in which they can exploit their natural strengths/or style. Secondly, through self-awareness, they are successful in ‘managing’ their ‘downsides’. Put simply, outstanding performers are good at what they are good at, and good at what they are less good at. We have found that through the use of the GPI, individuals are able to identify their own performance dynamic in order to exploit and manage their respective strengths and risks.

                <p class="text">
                    The GPI was initially developed in the early 90s by Dr Steve Glowinkowski. Many thousands of senior leaders, together with the young adult/teenage population, have taken the GPI questionnaire and received in-depth feedback. The GPI has subsequently helped those individuals achieve their potential, improve performance, enhance relationships, and build confidence.
