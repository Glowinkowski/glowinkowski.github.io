This involves looking at the reality of the current situation, gathering data and considering strengths and weaknesses, with a view to accomplishing immediate goals and objectives. However, she will still be comfortable flexing into conceptual thinking in order to consider future trends and dynamics that are likely to be more ambiguous. Nevertheless, her tendency is to be orientated towards more practical tasks and today's delivery.

This suggests that she prefers to use an intuition based approach to solving problems and making decisions. In this context, decision making is driven by her own insight and gut feeling about a situation irrespective of what the data says. This is not to say that rational facts are not thought out to validate an approach it simply implies that the approach of the intuitive decision maker tends to be more gut feeling driven. The upside of intuitive decision making is that problems and decisions can be addressed quickly and without getting caught up in analysis by paralysis. The downside of course, is that sometimes important information can be missed. Specimen's profile does show a balance and so she will be comfortable flexing towards the Rational when required.</p>","_SubDimensions":[]}]},{"_UnipolarName":"Agreeableness","_LeftBipolarName":"Collectivist","_RightBipolarName":"Individualist","_isParent":true,"_StenScore":7,"_ScoreText":"","_SubDimensions":[{"_UnipolarName":"Affiliation","_LeftBipolarName":"Affiliative","_RightBipolarName":"Unaffiliative","_isParent":false,"_StenScore":4,"_ScoreText":"<p>Test paragraph</p>","_SubDimensions":[]},{"_UnipolarName":"Trust","_LeftBipolarName":"Trusting","_RightBipolarName":"Questioning","_isParent":false,"_StenScore":6,"_ScoreText":"<p>Test paragraph</p>","_SubDimensions":[]},{"_UnipolarName":"Conformity","_LeftBipolarName":"Conforming","_RightBipolarName":"Dissenting","_isParent":false,"_StenScore":9,"_ScoreText":"<p>Test paragraph</p>","_SubDimensions":[]},{"_UnipolarName":"Modesty","_LeftBipolarName":"Modest","_RightBipolarName":"Assuming","_isParent":false,"_StenScore":7,"_ScoreText":"<p>Test paragraph</p>","_SubDimensions":[]}]},{"_UnipolarName":"Attainment","_LeftBipolarName":"Focused","_RightBipolarName":"Flexible","_isParent":true,"_StenScore":8,"_ScoreText":"","_SubDimensions":[{"_UnipolarName":"Implementation Style","_LeftBipolarName":"Outcome","_RightBipolarName":"Spontaneous","_isParent":false,"_StenScore":6,"_ScoreText":"<p>The Outcome/Spontaneous dimension relates to an individual's preference for a structured/organised as opposed to a flexible approach for the delivery of outcomes and results.

She is likely to enjoy balancing multiple tasks simultaneously but will be able to focus on each sufficiently to get it completed. She enjoys keeping their options open for as long as possible and can sometimes enjoy the experience more than the outcome.

She is likely to feel frustrated when required to focus in and concentrate on the details: as a result she may sometimes miss important information or fail to make thorough preparations.

Specimen may feel impatient with standards, or procedures, that she judges to be inefficient or wasteful and she may occasionally feel the need to cut corners in the pursuit of a goal.
