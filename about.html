            <h2>Background to the GPI</h2>
            <p>
                The Global Predisposition Indicator, or GPI, has been specifically designed to give insight into an individual’s strengths and development needs in the world of work. It has a twenty‐year history of successful use for executive coaching and recruitment in an international context.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the outset, it is important to note that the GPI measures a person’s predisposition or natural preference for behaviour. All of us exert self-discipline to behave in ways that run counter to our natural preference. So, for instance, a manager might dislike working with details, preferring to see the big picture. However, when it is necessary to review the organization’s finances, they know that it is important to pay careful attention to the figures. In this case, they might (a) exert self‐discipline and work with the detail even though it is not their natural predisposition or (b) delegate the work to someone trustworthy and pay careful attention to their findings. Thus, we find that motivation, self‐discipline, humility, and good delegation allow a manager to compensate for their own personal weaknesses.

            </p>
            <p>
                This means that we must be careful in making judgments about a person’s competence from the findings of the GPI. The GPI reports on a person’s natural predisposition or preference and highlights potential strengths and weaknesses; the recruiter’s task is then to carry out further investigation to see whether the individual ‘acts out’ according to their preference, or whether they have developed strategies for overcoming their natural tendencies. Indeed, it is also important to test out whether the natural inclinations are also actually delivered. The advantage of using the GPI is that it digs down to a deeper level than is discovered through a regular interview.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the caveat given above, we do find the GPI to be highly predictive of workplace behaviour and it certainly gives us a profound insight into the nature or character of the individual.

                At this overview level, the individual is allocated one of four styles in each of these three categories or frameworks. In a coaching context, this reporting structure is useful because it allows the person to identify people or situations that they are finding difficult, and to explore ways of adjusting their style to compensate. In a recruitment context, it allows us to see the type of work activities and interpersonal contexts that they are likely to find comfortable; giving insight into potential job: person fit.
            </p>
            <p>
                A unique feature of the GPI is that in addition to this useful reporting on ‘style’ (or ‘type’) there is also a series of sub‐scales which give the individual a profile as unique as their fingerprint. The GPI also reports on an individual’s Leadership Style – strengths and risks.
