<h1>About the CDI</h1>

<button type="button" class="cdi_collapsible"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i> What is the Career Directions Indicator?</button>
<div class="cdi_content">
	<p>Any given individual will tend to be drawn towards and enjoy jobs that involve particular types of behaviours that match with their own unique behaviour preferences. By behaviour preferences we broadly mean any task, activity, process, way of thinking about or doing things that an individual naturally enjoys.</p>
	<p>These preferences will be different for different people. For example one person may enjoy tasks that involve planning, while another may not like that at all, instead preferring activities that involve interacting with people.</p> 
	<p>Crucially, some people may find a wide variety of different tasks or activities highly enjoyable, while others may be more strongly drawn to a smaller set of specific activities. The key message here is that the nature of each individual’s behaviour preferences is unique to them.</p>
	<p>The Career Directions Indicator is an assessment tool designed to tap in to and tease out what an individuals unique profile of behaviour preferences are, in relation to career themes and vocational motives (the Career Themes model and Vocational Motives model are described in detail on the next pages).</p>
	<p>Being aware of your own behavioural preferences can help you to make informed career decisions, maximising the chance that you will find a job or a career pathway that really suits you, one that is fulfilling, challenging and enjoyable.</p>

<button type="button" class="cdi_collapsible"><i class="fa-solid fa-briefcase"></i> The Career Themes model</button>
<div class="cdi_content">
<p>The Careers Direction Indicator identifies how your behaviour preferences align with the 9 career themes shown in the model below. Each theme represents specific types of behaviour that will be relevant to different career paths. For example, someone with a preference for ‘People’ behaviours could be suited to a job in sales or in the police force, where there is plenty of opportunity to interact with others. Someone with a preference for ‘Investigative’ behaviours on the other hand might enjoy a career as a lawyer or a job in market research.</p>
<p>What is most valuable however is to look at what 2, 3 or 4 themes you align most strongly with. Looking at your top themes in conjunction with one another can help you to refine your career or job search and identify roles that tap in to your own unique combination of behaviour preferences.</p>

<button type="button" class="cdi_collapsible"><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> The Vocational Motives model</button>
<div class="cdi_content">
<p>The Careers Direction Indicator identifies how your behaviour preferences align with the 3 vocational motives shown in the model below. These vocational motives emerge time and again during discussions with people as common drivers for their career choices. Importantly, vocational motives speak to peoples longer term goals for their careers, rather than perhaps the first step in their career.</p>
<p>For example, someone with a preference for ‘Entrepreneurship’ may be suited to starting their own business or growing and developing an existing business in to something larger and more successful. This person may be able to achieve this straight out of school but actually they may find it valuable to work as an employee of a few different companies first, to gain useful experience and knowledge that they can utilise later. Equally someone with a preference for ‘Specialist’ cannot expect to become an expert overnight, it will require studying and working in their chosen field over many months and years.</p> 
<p>Appreciating what your own vocational motives are will help you make strategic decisions throughout the course of your career.</p>
