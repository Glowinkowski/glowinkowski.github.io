<h1>The survey</h1>

<button type="button" class="cdi_collapsible"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> Why complete the CDI?</button>
<div class="cdi_content">
	<p>The purpose of completing the Career Directions Indicator (CDI) is to provide you with feedback and insights about the types of careers/jobs/roles which might best suit your needs. It’s about finding the best fit for your fundamental interests and motivations within the world of work and jobs.</p>
	<p>The questions are positioned in terms of a Section A and a Section B. Section A focuses on your preferences and interests in terms of specific behaviours and activities associated with a role. Section B focuses on what are the broader aspects of a role which you may find more appealing and motivational.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="cdi_collapsible"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i> How to complete the CDI</button>
<div class="cdi_content">
	<p>You are presented with a series of ‘forced choice’ questions. Each question consists of two statements, each relating to a specific activity or behaviour that is perhaps a common feature of a particular role.</p>
	<p>For each question, you need to decide which of the two statements most relates to you in terms of your fundamental interests and you as an individual, i.e. which statement (A or B) do you like most, is more of a preference and is most like you. It may be that neither statement appeals to you, or that both statements are very appealing. Even if this is the case, a choice or decision must be made for one or the other.</p>
	<p>Have in mind a situation where you are asked to select one of two jobs and one is characterised by statement A and the other by statement B. Choose the statement which matches the job you prefer most.</p>
	
	<p>Here are two examples:</p>

	<p>INSERT IMAGE OF EXAMPLES HERE</p>

	<p>In the first example, the individual chose statement B. Here they might have ‘liked’ both statements, but given a choice, they opted for statement B as their preference of the two, but only as 'just preferable'.</p>
	<p>In the second example, they chose statement A as their preferred option, but the choice is much more pronounced, specifically ‘highly preferable’.</p>
